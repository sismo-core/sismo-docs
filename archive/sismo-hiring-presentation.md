# Sismo Presentation

Sismo is building a privacy-focused attestation system for Web3. Sismo enables you to create attestations from the historical data and reputation of your Ethereum accounts. These attestations are granular, meaning you can just reveal a single fact about yourself without leaking the others.

Sismoâ€™s first release, the ZK-MOSA Protocol (Zero Knowledge Monosource Attestation Protocol) will allow users to create Zero-Knowledge attestations, packaged as ZK Badges (Non Transferrable NFTs). These ZK Badges are effectively attestations of facts suwh as "owns more than 10 ETH". They do not reveal the source of any fact (i.e the Ethereum Account which holds the ETH, and all its corresponding history).

ZK Badges, using widely adopted NFT standards, can be easily used as access control tokens for web3 apps.

The Sismo team is made up of experienced cryptonatives who have been working on Ethereum since 2015 on projects like Aave, Sandbox, Kleros, and ConsenSys. Sismo also helps to organize \[ethcc]\([https://ethcc.io/](https://ethcc.io)), one of the largest crypto conferences in the world. \
The team is passionate about privacy-preserving technologies and is eager to bring them to mainstream usage. \
Sismo raised funds in 2021 from founders and investors from top crypto teams including AAVE, Axie Infinity, Product Hunt, Snapshot, ENS, Naval Ravikant, Nansen, Starkware, Delphi Digital, Ideo, Framework, Fabric Ventures, and many more.
