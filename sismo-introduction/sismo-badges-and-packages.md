# Attestation packages (+ Badges)

\
Sismo will offer several attestation packages (VCs, Non Transferable NFT, Oauth system) so Sismo attestations are easy to integrate with a wide range of apps. Packaged attestations should be thought as reputation and access control tools.\`

Sismo Badges are the first type of package for Sismo Attestations. \
Sismo also plans to release offchain packages that would allow to any web2 application to consume the attestation without the need to write it onchain.



Sismo Badges is a simple package layer on top of Sismo Attestations. Sismo Badges follow the ERC1155 standard and allow for easy integrations with Sismo Attestations.&#x20;
