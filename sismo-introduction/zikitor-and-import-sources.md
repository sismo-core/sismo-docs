# Zikitor and import sources



Generate cryptographic proofs from source accounts. These proofs will be consumed by attesters to validate attestation requests.



Zikitor is the user facing product. It is a privacy focused frontend that allows users to generate attestations (or more precisely provable claims that can then be verified by an attester). \
Zikitor features a vault where users can store encrypted their source Accounts from which they are willing to generate attestations.



Sismo Frontend, Zikitor, is a secure, privacy-first front-end that allows anyone to generate, from their Ethereum accounts, attestations. \
Zikitor is thought to become the go-to where users can safely aggregate their sources of reputation and history to generate the attestations they need to access their services. It aims at replacing traditionnal web2 SSO.

Zikitor will in its first release allow users to generate ZK Badges (and underlying ochain attestations).
