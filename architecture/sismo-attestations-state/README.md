# Sismo Attestations State

**Sismo Attestations State** (SAS) is the multi-chain data repository of all attestation collections and individual attestations created through [Sismo Attestation Protocol](../../protocol/sismo-attestation-protocol.md) (SAP).&#x20;

It constitutes the overall set of all attestations registries hosted on different blockchains and databases. One attestation registry will be deployed per blockchain (or offchain database) progressively supported by the SAP.

Each type of attestation _(e.g.: "CryptoPunk Owner" or "Registered in Proof of Humanity")_ is represented by an attestation collection which is assigned to specific slot in the SAS.&#x20;

All subsequent attestations generated by users are stored in the relevant attestation collection slot of one or several of the attestation registries composing the Sismo Attestations State.

The SAS has 2^256 attestation collections slots, divided in ranges called Shards.

The Sismo Attestation Protocol maintains a set of authorised [Attesters](../attester/) which are smart contracts allowed to write attestations in the SAS.&#x20;

Authorized [Attesters](../attester/) are assigned to a dedicated Shard in the SAS and receive write access on the underlying attestation collections.

Attestations are generated by Attesters and recorded in the SAS according to the [Standard Attestation Format](standard-attestation-format.md).
