# Sismo Attestations State

**Sismo Attestations State** (SAS) is the multi-chain data repository of all attestation collections and individual attestations created through Sismo Attestation Protocol (SAP).&#x20;

It constitutes the overall set of all attestations registries hosted on different blockchains and databases. One attestation registry will be deployed per blockchain (or offchain database) progressively supported by the SAP.&#x20;

Each type of attestation _(ex: "CryptoPunk Owner" or "Registered in Proof of Humanity")_ is represented by an attestation collection which is assigned to specific slot in the SAS.&#x20;

All subsequent attestations generated by users are stored in the relevant attestation collection slot of one or several of the attestation registries composing the Sismo Attestations State.

The SAS has 2^256 attestation collections slots, divided in ranges called Shards.

The Sismo Attestation Protocol maintains a set of authorised Attesters which are smart contracts allowed to write attestations in the SAS.&#x20;

Authorized Attesters are assigned to a dedicated Shard in the SAS and receive write access on the underlying attestation collections.
