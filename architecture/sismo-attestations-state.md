# Sismo Attestations State

The **Sismo Attestations State** (SAS) is the multi-chain registry of all attestation collections created through Sismo Attestation Protocol (SAP).&#x20;

It constitutes the overall set of all attestations registries hosted on different blockchains and databases. Each type of attestation is represented by an attestation collection which is assigned a specific slot.&#x20;

All subsequent attestations generated by users are stored in the relevant attestation collection slot of one or several of the attestation registries composing the Sismo Attestations State.

The Sismo Attestation Protocol maintains a set of authorised attesters which are smart contracts allowed to write attestations in the SAS.&#x20;

The SAS has 2^256 attestation collections slots, divided in shards.

Authorised attesters get each a dedicated shard in the SAS and receive write access on the underlying attestation collections.&#x20;
