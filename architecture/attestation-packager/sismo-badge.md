# Sismo Badge

**Sismo Badges** are Non Transferable NFT (ERC1155) which are wrappers of attestations. They bring usability to attestations. The score of an attestation is encoded in the balance&#x20;

Each attestation created is natively packaged as a badge. Any application can create its own custom badge.
