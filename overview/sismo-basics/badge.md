# Badge

A Sismo badge is an attestation that has been packaged as an ERC-1155 NFT to be easily read by web3 applications and smart contracts.&#x20;

By default (but it can be changed), Sismo badges are non-transferrable but they can be recovered by their original minter if they revoke the corresponding attestation(s), generate new one(s) linked to another destination controlled by the user and remint them. This makes Sismo Badges compliant to the "Soulbound NFT" concep^tttd-- t.
