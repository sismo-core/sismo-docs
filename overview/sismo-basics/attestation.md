# Attestation

Sismo Attestations are claims that have been attested by Sismo Attestation Protocol. Those claims, made by a user with his web3 source accounts, are verified by an attester smart contract which will check the validity of the proof generated by the user.

While Sismo Attestations can originate from different claiming protocols, they all share:

* the same format: the [Sismo Attestation Standard Format](../../architecture/sismo-attestations-state/attestation-standard-format.md).
* the same database: [Sismo Attestation State](../../archive/sismo-attestations-state.md) (SAS), the cross-chain registry of all attestations.

In a first phase, attestations will only be stored in smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains. In the future, other smart contracts platforms and hosted off-chain databases will store attestations to service different use cases.\
\
Attestations include the following information:

* XXX _(simplified list of attributes, detailed specs will only be shared in a,n Attestation Standard Format page)_
* YYY

If an attestation collection has been configured as such, attestations can be revoked by the Sismo account who generated them.
