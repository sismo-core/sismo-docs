# Destination

A Destination is an Ethereum or EVM chain address, imported by a user in his Sismo account, that is used to host the attestations he generates or to store the badge to be minted.&#x20;

A Destination is linked to a specific network (blockchain or hosted database) and must be chosen with care as it will expose attestation information to the public.\
\
When using private claiming protocols, this destination will not be linked to the sources used to generate attestations.
