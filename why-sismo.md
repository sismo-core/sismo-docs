# Why Sismo?

> There is, simply, no way, to ignore privacy. Because a citizenry’s freedoms are interdependent, to surrender your own privacy is really to surrender everyone’s.                                                                                                           __                                                                                                          &#x20;

### Most people don't really own their identity & reputation

You don’t own your identity on the most popular platforms of the Web2-era such ass Twitter, Facebook, or even your bank account. Instead, it is siloed and monetized by third parties. Your reputation is trapped and cannot move with you except by sharing via centralized third parties.

Web3 changes this. Your identity now lives on chain and your private keys prove that you are who you say you are. However, there are drawbacks. Your Ethereum address has a public transaction history that can reveal sensitive information. If you sign into an app with a Web3 wallet like MetaMask, you are also sharing all of this information.

New users typically start off with one or two Ethereum addresses that they use for everything. It’s convenient, but those addresses quickly accumulate a revealing history of their financial data, usage, and relationships. A simple transaction sending tokens from one wallet to another is enough to link them permanently.
{% endhint %}

Over time, users develop a need for multiple disconnected accounts. This has been accelerated by the rise of NFTs (including ENS domains) as users want publicly identifiable accounts (e.g. [vitalik.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045)) while still preserving the privacy of some of their on-chain activity. The tradeoff is that this user can no longer leverage the reputation of their other accounts.

### Private attestations and badges to the rescue

Sismo protocol provides a partial solution to these issues by enabling **** anyone to issue ZK badges for reputation aggregation and privacy preserving access control.

ZK badges are Zero-Knowledge attestations of facts imported from your other accounts, packaged as [Soulbound NFTs](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) (ERC-1155). For example, anyone can prove that they own a Bored Ape NFT so they can access a gated-website without having to reveal which specific NFT and which account it is stored in. \
\
These allow for crafting carefully curated pseudonymous personas which only reveal a facet of your identity that you consent to sharing publicly and nothing more.

Endless possibilities in terms of ZK badges can be explored to aggregate your on-chain history and attest any type of on-chain activity, while carefully selecting what one reveals about oneself. The privacy-preserving attestations issued by Sismo Protocol could even be used off-chain (not packaged as NFTs) to act as one-off credentials to access services.
