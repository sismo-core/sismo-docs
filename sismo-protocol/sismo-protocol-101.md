# Sismo Protocol 101

![////////////////// ILLUSTRATION PLACEHOLDER (PROTOCOL OVERVIEW) /////////////////////////](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-03-07 at 16.21.38.png>)

Sismo enables anyone to:

1. Manage [source accounts](https://sismo.gitbook.io/sismo/sismo-protocol/main-concepts/sources) (Web3 accounts) where their reputation history is stored
2. Save those source accounts privately in an encrypted Sismo [vault](https://sismo.gitbook.io/sismo/sismo-protocol/main-concepts/shielded-vault)
3. Mint privacy-preserving [ZK badges](https://sismo.gitbook.io/sismo/sismo-protocol/main-concepts/zk-badges) (attesting any fact imported from their sources) on any [destination account](https://sismo.gitbook.io/sismo/sismo-protocol/main-concepts/destinations) they own
4. Profit! (= flex them or use them to access fated services, exclusive airdrops, additional governance rights, etc..)
