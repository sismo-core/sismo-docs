# What is Sismo?

![](.gitbook/assets/ohoh.png)

Sismo is a modular **Attestation Protocol focused on decentralization, privacy and usability**.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Using Sismo, one can generate, from their web3 source accounts, a wide range of attestations such as "Owns of BAYC NFT", "Voted 2 times in ENS DAO" or "Sent more than 100 transactions on Ethereum".
{% endhint %}

Sismo Attestations are especially useful for

* Web2/web3 gated services
* Reputations systems
* Decentralized Identities Curation

When a user claims an attestation, it is recorded on-chain and they also receive the associated Badge (NFT representation of the underlying attestation).

ZK Attestations (e.g attestations that do not reveal the data origin) are at the main focus of Sismo but the protocol also features Public Attestations (e.g attestations linked to the actual source of information). These "doxing" attestation can also be useful, especially in combinaison with ZK Attestations.&#x20;

Generally, Sismo aims to offer a wide range of attestations, each with their own tradeoffs on privacy - decentralization - scalability.&#x20;

Sismo Product decentralised version of a Single Sign-On (SSO) system, based on web3 login and user-generated attestations.

Sismo Genesis Team is **the core engineering team developing software to support Sismo's mission**.&#x20;

It has 3 main roles:

## Sismo DAO

Sismo DAO is a **protocol DAO** launched in October 2021 to progressively oversee and manage the development and maintenance of Sismo Protocol. It started as a social DAO, gathering curated generations of members sharing similar interests about privacy, reputation, identity and zero-knowledge proofs.&#x20;

It is currently in charge of the allocation of Sismo DAO treasury and will move step by step towards an administrative role over Sismo Attestation Protocol.
