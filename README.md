# What is Sismo?

Sismo leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and privacy-preserving technologies to **enable** **users to aggregate their identities and selectively disclose personal data** to applications.&#x20;

By using Sismo Connect, an easy-to-integrate single sign-on (SSO), applications **can now obtain personal data that was previously inaccessible, while respecting user privacy.**

[Sismo Connect](./#sismo-connect-the-crypto-native-sso) aims to replace non-sovereign SSOs such as Google Connect and improve limited SSOs such as Wallet Connect.&#x20;

## Data Vault: Sovereign Identity Aggregator

Users aggregate their identity by adding Data Sources to their private, local and sovereign [Data Vault](data-vault/what-is-the-data-vault.md).

The Data Vault currently supports the following types of Data Sources: Ethereum wallets, GitHub, Twitter or Telegram accounts. Users can generate ZK proofs from their Data Sources, enabling them to reveal data to applications in a sovereign way.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>What a Data Vault looks like</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
You can create your own Data Vault and start aggregating your identity [here](https://vault-beta.sismo.io/).
{% endhint %}

## Sismo Connect: The Crypto-Native SSO

Sismo Connect is a crypto-native single sign-on (SSO) for onchain and offchain apps. Sismo Connect makes it easy for developers to access personal data without infringing on user privacy by requesting and verifying ZK proofs.

{% hint style="success" %}
Experience Sismo Connect on the [Demo App Store](https://demo.apps.sismo.io)!
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Sismo Connect Flow (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Integration is simple with just a few lines of code: import the front-end package or React button to make Sismo Connect requests, and verify proofs in your back end/smart contracts using Sismoâ€™s Solidity or TypeScript package.

With Sismo Connect, applications can request data from multiple sources at once. There are two types of requests that can be made:

* **Authentication**: ZK proof of Data Source ownership (e.g. Ethereum wallets, GitHub, Twitter or Telegram accounts).
* **Disclosure of anonymized personal data**: ZK proofs of Data Source inclusion in a specific Data Group (e.g. GR15 contributor).

{% hint style="info" %}
Data Groups are sets of Data Sources in which each Data Source has an associated value.

## Case Study: Sybil-Resistant Airdrop from Privately Aggregated Data

SafeDrop is a Sybil-resistant and privacy-preserving ERC20 airdrop that distributes $AIR tokens to users proportionally based on their reputation, aggregated from diverse sources of data (EVM wallets, Telegram, Twitter and GitHub accounts).

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/SafeDrop_Case Study (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By integrating Sismo Connect, SafeDrop users can generate a ZK proof to establish ownership of the data that makes them eligible for the airdrop. No connection between these accounts and the airdrop destination address is ever made.
