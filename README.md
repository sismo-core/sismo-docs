# What is Sismo?

![](<.gitbook/assets/1. MAIN LOGO+SISMO\_400x850.png>)

Sismo is an **attestation protocol focused on decentralization, sovereignty and privacy**.&#x20;

Sismo's mission is to build a user-friendly and trust-minimized product for everyone to:

* aggregate their reputation,
* curate their identities by controlling what they reveal about themselves,
* access web2/web3 gated services in a privacy preserving manner.

It allows anyone to generate attestations of claims issued from their personal accounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Using Sismo, one can generate, from their imported web3 source accounts, a wide range of attestations such as "Owns of BAYC NFT", "Voted 2 times in ENS DAO" or "Sent more than 100 transactions on Ethereum".
{% endhint %}

Sismo aims to contribute to the emergence of a decentralised version of a Single Sign-On (SSO) system, based on web3 login and user-generated attestations.&#x20;

These attestations of claims can be read "as-is" or be packaged as Sismo badges (ERC-1155 NFTs, non-transferrable by default), Verifiable Credentials or other custom formats.

One of Sismo's main feature is the ability to generate ZK attestations (powered by Zero Knowledge technology) to enable anyone to prove something without revealing the source of the claim.

## Sismo Genesis Team

Sismo Genesis Team is **the core engineering team developing software to support Sismo's mission**.&#x20;

It has 3 main roles:

* Kickstart the launch of Sismo Attestation Protocol
* Develop and maintain new claiming protocols
* Build tools improving the whole Sismo ecosystem

They are the initial core maintainers of Sismo Attestation Protocol, while the development and governance is to be progressively handed to Sismo DAO. They will propose new Claiming Protocols  and improve Sismo products and libraries so that Sismo attestations get widely adopted.

## Sismo DAO

Sismo DAO is a **protocol DAO** launched in October 2021 to progressively oversee and manage the development and maintenance of Sismo Protocol. It started as a social DAO, gathering curated generations of members sharing similar interests about privacy, reputation, identity and zero-knowledge technologies.&#x20;

It is currently in charge of the allocation of Sismo DAO treasury and will move step by step towards an administrative role over Sismo Attestation Protocol.
