# What is Sismo?

![](<.gitbook/assets/1. MAIN LOGO+SISMO\_400x850.png>)

Sismo is a modular **attestation protocol focused on decentralization, privacy and usability**.&#x20;

Sismo's mission is enable anyone to:

* access web2/web3 gated services in a privacy preserving manner,
* curate their identities by controlling what they reveal about themselves

Sismo users can generate attestations of claims issued from their personal accounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Using Sismo, one can generate, from their imported web3 source accounts, a wide range of attestations such as "Owns of BAYC NFT", "Voted 2 times in ENS DAO" or "Sent more than 100 transactions on Ethereum".
{% endhint %}

Sismo aims to contribute to the emergence of a decentralised version of a Single Sign-On (SSO) system, based on web3 login and user-generated attestations.

These attestations of claims can be read "as-is" or be packaged as Sismo badges (NFTs, non-transferrable by default) or other custom formats.

One of Sismo's main feature is the ability to generate ZK attestations (powered by Zero Knowledge Proofs) to enable anyone to prove something without revealing the source of the claim.

## Sismo Genesis Team

Sismo Genesis Team is **the core engineering team developing software to support Sismo's mission**.&#x20;

It has 3 main roles:

* Kickstart the Sismo Protocol
* Develop and maintain new attesters
* Build products and tools to improve usability

They are the initial core maintainers of Sismo Attestation Protocol, while the development and governance is to be progressively handed to Sismo DAO. They will propose new Claiming Protocols  and improve Sismo products and libraries so that Sismo attestations get widely adopted.

## Sismo DAO

Sismo DAO is a **protocol DAO** launched in October 2021 to progressively oversee and manage the development and maintenance of Sismo Protocol. It started as a social DAO, gathering curated generations of members sharing similar interests about privacy, reputation, identity and zero-knowledge proofs.&#x20;

It is currently in charge of the allocation of Sismo DAO treasury and will move step by step towards an administrative role over Sismo Attestation Protocol.
