# Sismo 101

### Sismo Core Mission

Sismo's main mission is to develop an attestation protocol focused on privacy, usability and decentralisation. The protocol should allow anyone to generate privacy preserving attestations, easily integrable in their web2 and web3 applications.

Using Sismo and its frontend Zikitor, one can generate, from their web3 source accounts, a wide range of attestations such as "Owner of BAYC NFT", "Voted 2 times in ENS DAO" or "Paid > 1 eth of fees on Ethereum".

Sismo goals is that its attestations can be used in a web3 alternative of centralised Single Sign-on systems (SSO), based on Decentralized Identifiers (DID).\
Sign In With Ethereum accounts and Sismo attestations is a good embryonic version of such as decentralized SSO.

Sismo Attestations are by default packaged as Badges. It is a NFT (ERC1155) package on top Sismo Attestations. This makes Sismo Attestations natively usable in all applications that use NFTs as reputation system or to control access to their services.

MAIN SCHEME

\[Centré autour des Sismo attestations. Centré autour du user qu utilise zikitor pour créer son attestation. Il peut ensuite utiliser cette attestation pour SIWE/ faire qqchose onchain]

### Sismo Protocol and the Sismo Attestation State

Sismo protocol is the set of rules linked to the creation, update and deletion of attestations in the Sismo Attestation State. The Sismo Attestations State (SAS) is the cross-chain database of all attestations created through Sismo Protocol.

Sismo DAO will govern the Sismo protocol. It will especially authorize/revoke authorized attestation protocols. Authorized attestations protocol are allowed to write in the Sismo Attestation State, each one gets allocated a slot in Sismo Attestation State.

SISMO PROTOCOL SCHEME

\[Centré autour de SAS: montrer que plusieurs attestations protocols ont des slots dans le SAS. Montrer que la DAO peut authorize/revoke. Montrer que cette DB est multi chain]

### Sismo Genesis Team

Sismo Genesis Team is an engineering team developing software to support Sismo Mission. It has three main roles:

* Develop Sismo Protocol core software
* Develop Zikitor Frontend to access Sismo Protocol
* Propose new ZK Attestation Protocols to Sismo Protocol

The development and governance of the protocol will be progressively handed to the Sismo DAO.

The end goal of the Genesis Team is that the protocol is governed autonomously and new frontend competing with Zikitor will emerge.

Sismo Genesis Team will also propose new attestation protocols focused on decentralized and trustless privacy while other external teams can propose attestations  protocols with different tradeoffs on privacy, centralisation and transparency.
