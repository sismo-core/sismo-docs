{% endhint %}

## What is Sismo Protocol?

Sismo protocol aims to be a trustless and decentralized credential management system powered by Ethereum. For example, it enables anyone to prove that they own a Bored Ape NFT so they can access a gated-website without having to reveal which specific NFT and which account it is stored in.

The initial release of Sismo protocol will issue ZK badges (non-transferrable NFTs) that prove that a user owns accounts fulfilling a specific set of requirements (ex: owning >= 10 ETH), while protecting the privacy of the accounts holding that ETH. Endless possibilities in terms of ZK badges can be explored to aggregate one's on-chain history and attest any type of on-chain activity.\
\
Potential ZK badges requirements:

* Executed their first transaction in 2017,
* Deployed a contract,
* Owns >= $10k of stablecoins,
* Owns a Cryptopunk,
* Is a certified human,&#x20;
* is an active partipant in AAVE governance.

## What is Sismo DAO?

Sismo DAO is a **protocol DAO** launched in October 2021 to progressively oversee and manage the development and maintenance of Sismo Protocol. It started as a social DAO, gathering curated generations of members sharing similar interests about privacy, reputation, identity and zero-knowledge technologies.&#x20;

Through progressive decentralization, it is now in charge of the allocation of a DAO treasury and will move step by step towards an administrative role over Sismo protocol along with the product release.
