# Sismo 101

### Sismo Core Mission

Sismo's main mission is to develop an attestation protocol focused on privacy, usability and decentralisation. The protocol should allow anyone to generate attestations easily integrable in their web2 and web3 applications.

Using Sismo and its frontend Zikitor, one can generate, from their web3 source accounts, a wide range of attestations (= certificates proving any state of facts) such as "Owner of BAYC NFT", "Voted 2 times in ENS DAO" or "Paid > 1 ETH of fees on Ethereum".

Sismo's goal is to enable the generation of attestations that can be used as a web3 alternative of centralised Single Sign-On systems (SSO), based on Decentralized Identifiers (DID).\
"Sign-In With Ethereum" accounts associated with a set of Sismo attestations are a minimum viable implementation of such a sovereign SSO.

Sismo Attestations are to be packaged as badges by default. Sismo badges are NFTs (ERC-1155, non-transferrable by default) wrapping the data of Sismo Attestations. This enables Sismo Attestations to be natively integrated in any application already using NFTs as a reputation system component, to control access to their services or to curate an identity.

MAIN SCHEME

\[Centré autour des Sismo attestations. Centré autour du user qu utilise zikitor pour créer son attestation. Il peut ensuite utiliser cette attestation pour SIWE/ faire qqchose onchain]

### Sismo protocol and Sismo Attestations State

Sismo protocol is the set of rules linked to the creation, update and deletion of attestations in  Sismo Attestations State. Sismo Attestations State (SAS) is the cross-chain database of all attestations created through Sismo Protocol.

Sismo protocol will be governed by Sismo DAO whose responsibility will be, among other things, to authorize new attestation protocols or revoke others. Authorized attestation protocol are allowed to write in Sismo Attestations State and are allocated a dedicated slot (a range of attestation IDs).

### Sismo Genesis Team

Sismo Genesis Team is an engineering team developing software to support Sismo Mission. It has three main roles:

* Develop Sismo Protocol core software
* Develop Zikitor Frontend to access Sismo Protocol
* Propose new ZK Attestation Protocols to Sismo Protocol

The development and governance of the protocol will be progressively handed to the Sismo DAO.

The end goal of the Genesis Team is that the protocol is governed autonomously and new frontend competing with Zikitor will emerge.

Sismo Genesis Team will also propose new attestation protocols focused on decentralized and trustless privacy while other external teams can propose attestations  protocols with different tradeoffs on privacy, centralisation and transparency.
