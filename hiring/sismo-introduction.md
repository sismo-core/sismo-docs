# Sismo Introduction

Sismo is building a privacy-focused attestation system for Web3. Sismo enables you to create attestations from the historical data and reputation of your Ethereum accounts. These attestations are granular, meaning you can just reveal a proved fact about yourself.

Sismoâ€™s first release, the ZK-MOSA Protocol (Zero Knowledge Monosource Attestation Protocol) will allow users to create Zero-Knowledge attestations, packaged as ZK Badges (Non Transferrable NFTs). These ZK Badges are effectively attestations of facts like "has more than 10 ETH", they do not reveal the source of this fact (i.e the Ethereum Account which holds the ETH, and all its corresponding history).

ZK Badges, as NFTs, can be easily used as access control tokens for web3 apps.
